# MLproject
Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects Repositor
This project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system specifically designed to extract and interpret information from Aadhar cards. The Aadhar card is a government-issued identification document in India that contains crucial personal information, such as the individual's name, unique Aadhar number, address, and more. The OCR system will automate the process of extracting this information from Aadhar cards, streamlining tasks that require data entry and verification.

Project Features
Aadhar Card Recognition: The core functionality of this project is to recognize and extract relevant information from scanned or photographed Aadhar cards.

Text Extraction: The system will use OCR techniques to extract text from Aadhar card images. This text will include the individual's name, Aadhar number, date of birth, address, and other essential details.

Data Validation: The extracted data will be validated to ensure accuracy and completeness. Error handling mechanisms will be implemented to handle any discrepancies in the extracted information.

User-Friendly Interface: A user interface will be developed to allow users to upload Aadhar card images, view the extracted data, and make corrections if necessary.

Security and Privacy: Security measures will be implemented to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the extracted data. Adequate measures will be taken to handle sensitive information in compliance with relevant data protection laws.
